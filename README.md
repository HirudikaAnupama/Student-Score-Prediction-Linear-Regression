<h1 align="center">Student Score Prediction Using Linear Regression</h1>
<p align="center">Most of the linear regression theory is covered in this project.</p>
<p align="center">Using these theories, we can predict students' marks through this program.</p>

## Introduction
- When we train the machine learning model we need to follow several steps.
- While training this linear regression machine learning algorithm, we need to follow some steps to make the model accurate and fast. Amoung them are things like,<br>
  ##### _Data Collecting_
  ##### _Data Preprocessing_ 
  ##### _Data Analysis_
  ##### _Split the Data into training and testing_
  ##### _Evaluate the Model_
  ##### _Check model performance_
  ##### _Fine-tune the Model_

- A better understanding of these can be obtained from the following introduction and relative code sections related to the introduction can be obtained by observing the code.

### Data Collecting

- We must collect the data we need according to our needs.
- Depending on the target variable (dependent variable/ our predictor variable/ y) we need to collect other data (characteristics/ independent variables/ Features).

### Data Preprocessing 

- After collecting the data we need to clean it,<br>
  ##### _find missing data and fill them_
  ##### _Drop duplicate data_
  ##### _Turn categorical data into numerical or Boolean_
  ##### _Rename columns for easily understand_
  ##### _Separate target value and features_
  
- We can use Encoding method or dummy method for convert categorical data into numerical or boolean.

### _Data Analysis_
